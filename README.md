# Claude Code Workflow

A straightforward, no-nonsense workflow setup for Claude Code that just works. Drop it in your project and go.

## What's this?

This is my personal Claude Code workflow that I'm sharing with the community. It's designed to be simple, no unnecessary complexity, no bloat. Just the essentials to get cover the most important aspects of developing with AI agents based on my own experience.

## How to use

1. Download the workflow
2. Drop the `.claude` folder in your project
3. Start coding

## Updates

I'll be updating this as I use it myself, adding improvements and refinements based on day to day usage. The goal is to maintain the simplicity while making it better over time.
