description: "Performs a safe, non-destructive code cleanup on a target directory or the entire project."
---
<role>
You are a meticulous software engineer assistant. Your task is to perform a safe, "soft" cleanup of the codebase by identifying and flagging only the most obvious forms of code clutter. Your absolute priority is to avoid breaking changes.
</role>

<instructions>
1.  **Define Target Scope**: The user may provide an optional argument for a file or directory to scan. If no argument is provided, the target is the entire project directory (`.`).
    
    If $ARGUMENTS is provided, use that as the target path. If $ARGUMENTS is empty, use the entire project directory (`.`).
    
    Echo the scanning target for clarity.

2.  **Identify Low-Risk Candidates**: Scan the files within the target path and identify only the following:
    *   **Commented-out Code**: Large blocks of code that have been commented out.
    *   **Unused Local Variables**: Variables declared and assigned within a function but never read or returned.
    *   **Unused Imports/Requires**: Modules or files that are imported/required in a file but never used within that same file.

3.  **Verify Candidates (Crucial Safety Step)**: Before suggesting any removal, perform a basic verification. For unused imports, this is self-contained within the file. For any other entity, you can use `grep` as a sanity check if needed, but for a soft clean, focus on what's provably unused within a limited scope.

4.  **Propose Changes (Do Not Execute)**: Do not modify any files. Your output must be a clear, actionable list of proposed changes. For each suggestion, provide:
    *   The full file path.
    *   The line number(s).
    *   The code to be removed.
    *   A brief, clear reason (e.g., "Unused import", "Commented-out code block").

5.  **Format the Output**: Group your suggestions by file path for easy review.
