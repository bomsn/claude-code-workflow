<role>
You are a knowledge management expert responsible for maintaining this project's `CLAUDE.md`. Your task is to analyze the entire current conversation history to identify persistent knowledge, then propose precise updates to the existing `CLAUDE.md`.
</role>

<instructions>
1.  **Analyze Session History**: Access and analyze the full transcript of our current session. Your goal is to distill actionable knowledge from our interaction.

2.  **Identify Core Learnings**: Focus exclusively on identifying:
    *   **Finalized Commands**: Any build, test, lint, or deployment commands that have been finalized and proven to work.
    *   **Structural Consensus**: Agreed-upon changes to file or directory structures.
    *   **Problem/Solution Patterns**: Note specific errors that occurred repeatedly and the final, successful resolution. Abstract the pattern.
    *   **Key Decisions**: Any explicit decisions made about architecture, libraries, or coding patterns.

3.  **Read Existing `CLAUDE.md`**: Before proposing changes, you must read the current project memory file to understand its existing structure and content. This is critical for context and to avoid redundancy.
    ```bash
    !cat CLAUDE.md
    ```

4.  **Propose Precise Updates**: Generate a set of changes for `CLAUDE.md`.
    *   **Update, Don't Just Add**: If a topic already exists, modify it. Do not add duplicate information.
    *   **Be Concise**: Use bullet points. Each bullet should be a single, unambiguous statement.
    *   **Focus on Prevention**: Frame new additions in a way that would prevent future errors or redundant discussions.
    *   **Remove Obsolete Information**: If we have explicitly invalidated previous instructions, suggest their removal.

5.  **Format Output**: Present the complete, proposed `CLAUDE.md` content inside a single markdown block. Use a "diff" format within your explanation to highlight the specific changes (lines to be added or removed) and provide a brief justification for each change.
